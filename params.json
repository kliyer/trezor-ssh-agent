It receives identity requests from SSH client (which gets it from SSH server), uses Trezor hardware to sign challenge and sends data back.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n* Only ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 key is supported at current. ssh-ed25519 may come in future. ssh-rsa is not supported by Trezor HW.\r\n* Trezor wallet with passphrase protection is not supported.\r\n* No other Trezor app (like myTREZOR webpage) can be running simultaneously.\r\n* BIP32 path is currently fixed by constant Identity URI to just one public key per device.\r\n* KeepKey device not supported, this may change in future.\r\n* They are troubles on USB level that makes device deattach from time to time. Unplug&plug device or/and restart Trezor SSH Agent to workaround it. This problem will be hopefully fixed by MultiBit guys soon.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n#### Start\r\n\r\nDownload and run EXE binary from latest release. OR:\r\n\r\nBuild your own java and run class com.trezoragent.gui.StartAgentGUI main.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\nTrezor SSH Agent uses the standard Maven build process and can be used without having external hardware attached. Just do the usual:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd <project directory>\r\n$ mvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n* Please  [download](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) latest DEVELOPMENT snapshot of Putty or WinSCP 5.8.1+ that support ECDSA and Ed25519 keys. Latest STABLE versions of Putty and WinSCP do not support ECDSA yet and will not work with Trezor.\r\n* After started the app, find Trezor icon in Windows tray area and right click to open menu.\r\n* Click \"Show Public Key\" to get your openSSH public key. Provide PIN if asked. Place key on SSH server in your user authorized_keys file.\r\n* Start Putty with \"Attempt authentication using Pageant\" option selected (Connection->SSH->Auth).\r\n* Use Putty to connect to your favorite SSH server.\r\n* Provide PIN if asked and confirm identity sign operation on the device.\r\n\r\n#### Public Key Example\r\n`ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBKJHh8o1FNgyEXzPLIc7tlk4n+4/mLlCs/m/SY7+WsUhdoajyHiyP0Zdo+VuWAizLTApW68QIzqWY73fur+i7nk= Trezor`\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n* Martin Lizner - author\r\n* Gary Rowe (MultiBit) - Trezor Java API\r\n* Roman Zeyde - Trezor SSH Agent in Python\r\n\r\nBitcoin donations: 1QEKWJFAqwkCxPotJoGpfaFDnaShjiNtb5 \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
